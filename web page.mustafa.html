               <pre>               <strong>      
                  <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah, one of the fearless, determined, and strong-willed leaders, fought for Muslim rights with his willpower and comprehensive knowledge. He was born on 25th December 1876 in Karachi. He studied Law at the Lincoln’s Inn in London and return to India to perform the role of a barrister, politician, and a great leader of his time. 

                     Quaid-e-Azam struggled half of his life and became the first Governor-General of the promising state of Pakistan on 15th August 1947. It was a new responsibility, and the way he achieved was not easy. Not only Quaid-e-Azam sacrificed many of the parts of his life for this separate Muslim homeland, but also he motivated and guided his people to unite, fight, and stand on one point till the end. 
                     
                     It all started when Hindus of India were not accepting Muslims’ presence and was creating problems for them.
                     <br> In the early years of his political journey, he first managed to remove the differences between the Indians and Muslims, and he also came up with the fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. When all this did not work, it was the time when Quaid-e-Azam resigned from the congress, especially seeing their agreement with the satyagraha, naming it as political anarchy.
                     
                     He deadly fought for a separate nation just after that and warned Hindus that either they have to give Muslims their rights or complete peace of land.
                     <br> Jinnah establishes the new nation’s policies and never left his people alone.
                     <br> He aided the Millions of Muslim migrants who left everything on migration.
                     <br> This time of the journey was hardest as thousands of Muslims got killed in trains while migrating towards their new Homeland. Thesis help is one of the best Pakistan’s writing services that provide many detailed essays and write-ups depicting the personality of the great Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Also, they have mentioned the details of how he used to perform daily conferences, meetings, and other activities to get the rights for the Muslims. Today, many leaders worldwide recognize Mohammad Ali Jinnah as one of the resilient leaders and feel proud to follow in his footsteps. 
                     
                      Quaid-e-Azam died on the 11th of September, 1948. He served his life for Pakistan. He was a man of rules and always focused on the rights of his people. He always emphasized education, stating that the future of our country depends upon the education we will manage to provide in the future. He maintained equality and defined the role of both men and women in the development of a prosperous state. He also emphasized industrial development that he understood the main event of the country’s economic growth. He was so brave and resolute that even he was in the hardest part of his health. He never stops looking after his people. He strengthens them throughout till the end of his life, and it was just a year pass of achievement, of his dreamland, he died instructing his people to be on a straight path and follow his directions. </p>
